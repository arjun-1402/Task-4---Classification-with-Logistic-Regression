# Task-4---Classification-with-Logistic-Regression

This project is a binary classification model built using logistic regression to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign, based on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The pipeline includes loading and preprocessing the dataset with pandas, handling missing values using mean imputation, standardizing features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. A logistic regression model is then trained using scikit-learn, and its performance is evaluated through confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score. The ROC curve shows strong model performance, with the curve closely hugging the top-left corner. The sigmoid function at the core of logistic regression maps any real-valued input to a probability between 0 and 1, allowing the model to make binary decisions by applying a threshold (usually 0.5), which can be tuned to balance sensitivity and specificity
